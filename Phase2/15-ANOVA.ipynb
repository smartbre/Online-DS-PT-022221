    "## T tests or ANOVA?\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare whether multiple groups differ in some type of measures. For example, we have collected mood data grouped by four types of weather - sunny, raining, overcast, or cloudy, and we want to find out whether there is a difference in mood across different weather. What tests would you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural reaction would be to conduct multiple t-tests. However, that comes with many drawbacks. First, you would need $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ t tests, which come out to 6 tests. Having more tests meaning having higher chance of making type I error. In this case, our original probability of making type I error grew from 5% to 5% x 6 = 30%! By conducting 6 tests and comparing their mean to each other, we are running a huge risk of making false positives. This is known as the multiple comparison problem. \n",
